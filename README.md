Our current bots are as follows:

## Reddit Posting Bot

* Our very first bot is Reddit Posting Bot which is implemented by Reddit API and Tweeter API.

* This bot is used to tweet 3 latest and hot posts from a Subreddit called 'worldnews'. 

* The implementation can be changed to any other Subreddit.

## Follow Followers Bot

* This bot is also implemented as others with Tweeter API.

* Follows the users who follows the account you have entered. 

## Fav and Retweet

* The last but not least, the fav and retweet bot is designed to track a selected user's timeline in order to
  fav and retweet selected tweets or all tweets that tracked user sent.

* In our bot, we track the user called 'earthquakeBot' in order to fav and retweet those tweets to notify people for any earthquake with 5.0+ magnitude all around the world.
